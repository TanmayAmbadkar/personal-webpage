            <li>My research focuses on a specification-guided framework to enhance the reliability, safety, and interpretability of RL agents.</li> 
            <li>I develop methods for automatic refinement of specifications to ensure task satisfaction and enable safe exploration in high-dimensional environments.</li> 
            <li>In collaboration with Kitware and the DoD, I am advancing human-tunable policies that generate multiple courses-of-action without retraining.</li>

            <li>I am working on predicting cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder in children within the age of 24 months, using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, by using time-series models. </li> 
            <li>Using PySpark, I preprocessed a dataset over 500GB to gather data for over 600000 patients. This data was used for cross-validation for multiple models to determine the best fit and most important features contributing to the final binary decision</li>

            <li>I was responsible for detecting anomalies in data using AutoEnCoder models and using explainable AI (SHAP) to identify which features contribute to the anomalies. I developed a plug-and-play library for this having multiple layers of abstraction and obfuscation to protect intellectual property.</li> 
            <li>I experimented with deep learning models and modifying workflows to create a library which could be used with any time-series data from multiple sources (csv, sql, influxdb). Demonstrated Proof-of-concpt using DataBricks on Siemens Buildings data to an internal team.</li> 
            <li>I performed exploratory data analysis on coffee roaster data from Starbucks to identify burner cuts and its relation with other variables. I trained time-series models to predict burner cuts and developed a real-time prediction library to demonstrate its efficacy. </li>
