<h3><u>About me</u></h3>
<p>
    I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Penn State, advised by Dr. Abhinav Verma. My research focuses on building trustworthy AI by integrating reinforcement learning with the safety and verification principles of programming languages. I develop novel frameworks that enable agents to learn from imperfect human guidance and operate within critical safety constraints, paving the way for their use in complex, high-stakes environments.
