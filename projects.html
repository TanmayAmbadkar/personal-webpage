        <h5>Shared Critic PPO for building energy and comfort optimization</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This project was part of EE597 - Reinforcement Learning. We developed a shared-critic PPO algorithm that optimises energy and comfort for a building using
                multiple agents. The simulator (sinergym) used for EPlus and bctvb to provide a gym-like environment for this task.

        <h5>Robust and Secure Deep Learning</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This repository has a set of 4 projects that were a part of CSE597 - Robust and Secure Deep learning. The projects involve designing test-time evasion attacks
                on the MNIST dataset and identifying them using a detector, and poisoning the dataset prior to training with an imperceptible pattern and then estimating that pattern
                using gradient descent

        <h5>Deep learning for Strong Gravitational Lensing Images</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This project involves solving several tasks related to dark matter. I used convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for tasks like classification, denoising and superresolution.

        <h5>Lead Scoring</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This project involved scoring leads for a marketing application. I performed exploratory data analysis and created a logistic regression model and a 
                lead rating system that could be used by the marketing team to identify potential customers.

        <h5>Certificate Generator</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I developed a certificate generator and repository Website for events of IIIT Vadodara. This sped up the process of 
                delivering certificates to winners and participants and gave them an e-repository to verify the authenticity of certificates.
            </li> 
            <li>
                I Coded the backend to manage mass-mailing of certificates and to generate a unique Code which could be used to identify the certificate.

        <h5>Gymkhana Website</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I developed the student gymkhana Website for IIIT Vadodara, where clubs and committees could showcase their activities and events.
            </li> 
            <li>
                I developed a role management system for clubs and committees, and built a calender system to show upcoming activities.
