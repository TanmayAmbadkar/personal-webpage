                I am Tanmay Ambadkar, a graduate student at PennState (MS in CSE with a focus on AI). I graduated from IIIT Vadodara with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which has driven me to pursue a master's at PennState. I am currently working with Dr. Abhinav Verma on Neurosymbolic methods in AI. I am also working on Big Data Analytics and predictive modeling for Electronic Health Records with Dr. Qiushi Chen. 
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                I have worked on research projects in Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing to improve the state-of-art models with Prof. Mazumdar and Prof. Bhatt during my final year at IIIT Vadodara. In addition, I have worked with the Research and Development division of Siemens, Bangalore, to develop multiple Proof Of Concepts and libraries using Deep Learning. I have worked with textual data as well as time-series data at Siemens. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, I have worked with backend development using Flask and Django. I have developed several projects for IIIT Vadodara, which impact all the students. I have also been an integral part of clubs and societies at IIIT Vadodara by serving as the President of the Technical Committee. I was also a core member of the IIITV Coding Club and Encore - The music club of IIIT Vadodara.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am open to working in Machine Learning/Data Science roles, involving Deep learning and Reinforcement learning. I am looking for Full Time roles starting Summer 2024.

                    Using PySpark, I preprocessed a dataset over 500GB to gather data for over 500000 patients. This data was used for

                    I was responsible for detecting anomalies in data using AutoEncoder models and using explainable AI (SHAP) to identify which features
                    contribute to the anomalies. I developed a plug-and-play library for this having multiple layers of abstraction and obfuscation to
                    protect intellectual property.

                <li>
                    I experimented with deep learning models and modifying workflows to create a library which could be used with 
                    any time-series data from multiple sources (csv, sql, influxdb). Demonstrated Proof-of-concpt using DataBricks on 
                    Siemens Buildings data to an internal team.

                    I performed exploratory data analysis on coffee roaster data from Starbucks to identify burner cuts and its relation
                    with other variables. I trained time-series models to predict burner cuts and developed a real-time prediction library 
                    to demonstrate its efficacy.
