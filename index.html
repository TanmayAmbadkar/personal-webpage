                I am a graduate student at PennState (MS in CSE with a focus on AI). I graduated from IIIT Vadodara with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which has driven me to pursue a master's at PennState. I am currently working with Dr. Abhinav Verma on Neurosymbolic methods in AI. I am also working on Big Data Analytics and predictive modeling for Electronic Health Records with Dr. Qiushi Chen. 
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                I have worked on research projects in Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing to improve the state-of-art models with Prof. Mazumdar and Prof. Bhatt during my final year at IIIT Vadodara. In addition, I have worked with the Research and Development division of Siemens, Bangalore, to develop multiple Proof Of Concepts and libraries using Deep Learning. I have worked with textual data as well as time-series data at Siemens. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, I have worked with backend development using Flask and Django. I have developed several projects for IIIT Vadodara, which impact all the students. I have also been an integral part of clubs and societies at IIIT Vadodara by serving as the President of the Technical Committee. I was also a core member of the IIITV Coding Club and Encore - The music club of IIIT Vadodara.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am open to working in Machine Learning/Data Science roles, involving Deep learning and Reinforcement learning. I am looking for Full Time roles starting Summer 2024.

                    This project was part of EE597 - Reinforcement Learning. We developed a shared-critic PPO algorithm that optimises energy and comfort for a building using
                    multiple agents. The simulator (sinergym) used for EPlus and bctvb to provide a gym-like environment for this task.
